# External Tools - Addon where external (not already included in unity) tools can be added. Typical use for this will be binaries.

## Instructions:
* Place arm and x86 compiled binaries into their respective folders inside tools directory and unity will load them/add them to path automatically so you can call them like any other binary (no need to specify path)
* Place other cpu architecture independent tools into the other folder and unity will load them/add them to path automatically so you can call them like any other binary (no need to specify path)
* If you want to include a binary into your module itself (like for a boot script), the binaries are located at: $INSTALLER/common/unityfiles/tools during the (un)install process

## Included Binaries/Credits:
