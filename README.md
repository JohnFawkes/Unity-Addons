# Unity-Addons
Repository of Addons for [Unity Installer](https://github.com/Zackptg5/Unity)

## Usage:
* In the root of your unity installer zip, make an "addon" folder
* Copy the addons of choice from this repo into the created addon folder
* Ex: addons/APK-Patcher
* Read the README in each repo addon folder for usage
* Don't delete/modify anything in the addon folder unless readme says otherwise
* Note that you can compress the addon folder into a tar.xz file to save space. Ex: `tar -xJf addon.tar.xz addon`
